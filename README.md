## Netlimiter (5.3.6.0) DLL with some renamed strings to allow u to use it on D2!

# How to use :3
- Close D2 or any game that currently blocks Netlimiter
- Download [Netlimiter 5.3.6.0](https://download.netlimiter.com/nl/netlimiter-5.3.6.0.exe)
- Extract the [files](https://img.grr.ovh/rina/y7F) to `C:\Program Files\Locktime Software\NetLimiter`
- Open askua.exe or whatever you renamed ur exe too and pin it to start/taskbar or make a shortcut for whatever and ur good to go <3

> You can just replace the DLL and rename the default execuable if you'd like, but to be safe for dumb changes just use mine, it has some changes aswell it's not just renamed \_(ãƒ„)_/
> 
> Everything done is very simple, it's nothing crazy
>
> You can open it ingame, or whenever you want btw

- PSA, searching the word Netlimiter, or having a tab open with the word in it flags D2. Close d2 while installing, and pin the askua.exe to ur taskbar after u open it or something 

- Games Tested: ``R6S, Destiny 2, Overwatch 2, DayZ, all other BE games I've played``
